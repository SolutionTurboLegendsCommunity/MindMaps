# MindMaps
Welcome to the Mind Map repository! 

These one-page overviews are packed with guidelines to help you navigate a variety of Microsoft products and services on your solution implementation journey. The content you will find here is based on best practice obtained from real world cases.

Starting from the left-hand side, you will find broad feature areas that you may have questions about. As you navigate through the Mind Maps towards the right, you will see many branching paths for you to consider. The very end of each path will lead you to community content, such as YouTube videos, blog posts, or official Microsoft Learn documentation.

Please download the PDF of your interest and browse the information in your preferred application.

We hope this helps bridge any gaps as you take your first steps building on Microsoft technology!
